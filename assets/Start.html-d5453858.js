However, before you install anything, you should set up a new project folder.</p><h3 id="setting-up-a-project-folder" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setting-up-a-project-folder" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Setting up a project folder</h3><p>Like any other project, you should have a dedicated folder to keep it organized and manageable.</p><p>Navigate to a place on your machine that&#39;s easy to find and reopen in the future for convenience purposes. Create a new folder like you normally would (depending on your OS, you can use <code>mkdir project-name</code> inside your terminal). If you already have a name you want to use for your bot, you can use that as the folder name. Otherwise, you may name it something like <code>discord-bot</code> for the time being (or anything else you have in mind).</p><p>Once you&#39;re done making the folder, open it up (depending on your OS, you can use <code>cd project-name</code> inside your terminal).</p><h3 id="opening-the-command-prompt" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#opening-the-command-prompt" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Opening the command prompt</h3><p>If you&#39;re on Linux, you can quickly open up the terminal with <code>Ctrl + Alt + T</code>.</p><p>If you&#39;re on Windows and aren&#39;t familiar with opening up the command prompt, do the following:</p><ol><li>Open your bot project folder.</li><li>Hold down the <code>Shift</code> key and right-click inside the folder.</li><li>Choose the &quot;Open command window here&quot; option.</li></ol><p>It should then open up a window with a black background. It&#39;s a bit unattractive, but we&#39;ll talk about using better, more powerful tools in a different part of the guide.</p><h3 id="using-the-command-prompt" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-command-prompt" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Using the command prompt</h3><p>With the command prompt open, run the <code>node -v</code> command to make sure you&#39;ve successfully installed Node.js. If you see something like <code>v16.6</code> or higher, great! If not, go back and try installing again.</p><p>The next command you&#39;ll be running is <code>npm init</code>. This command creates a <code>package.json</code> file for you, which will keep track of the dependencies your bot uses and other info. If you&#39;re a bit confused by that, you can ignore it for the time being.</p><p>The <code>npm init</code> command will ask you a sequence of questionsâ€“you should fill them out as you see fit. If you&#39;re not sure of something or want to skip it as a whole, leave it blank and press enter.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>Want to get started quickly?
